The scaled data shows that females in parlimen are not highly correlated with maternal mortality rate
as well as adoscelence birth rate. There is also negative correlation between expected education and life 
expectancy with maternal mortality ratio aand adolexcence birth rate. The countries that are
closer together are more correlated.

The plot using the scaled data seems more accurate (when we refer to the correlation plot)
because the data are all compared on the same scale.



There is a high, significant correlation between life expectancy and 
expected education (0.79) and expected education and GNI (0.62). There 
is also a high negative correlation between expected education (-0.73)
and adolescence birth rate (-0.7). Life expectancy also has a high positive
correlation (0.63) with GNI. There is also a high negative correlation 
between life expectancy and maternal mortality rate (-0.85) and life expectancy and
adolescence birth rate (-0.72). There is also a significant correlation between GNI and 
adolescence birth rate (-0.55) and maternal mortality rate and adolescence birth rate (0.75).
